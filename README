Ballfield 1.0 SDL 1.2
=====================


                     Ballfield
                     ---------

Here's a cute little thing that should bring back
memories from the days of the Amiga and Atari ST,
and the old demo scene culture. I played with other
stuff most of the time on my Amiga, so I guess I'll
have my fun now, when it's dead simple and you
don't even have to hack any asm code! ;-)


The program supports a few command line options:

	-f	Fullscreen
	-nd	No Double Buffering
	-h	Use Hardware Surface
	-<n>	Depth = <n> bits
	-na	Don't use antialiazing
